# Description

This Dice Roller was inspired by a lack of efficient, aesthetically pleasing, accessible Dice Rollers online. The gloas are as follows:

1. <u>Fask and Easy:</u> Rolling a dice should take no more than a quick button press.
2. <u>Aesthetically Pleasing:</u> The UI should be nice to look at, support light/dark mode, and different color combinations.
3. <u>Accessible:</u> The website is compatible with WCAG 2.1 AA standards, so anyone can use it for DnD.
