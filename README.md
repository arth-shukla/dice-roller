# Description and Motivation

This Dice Roller was inspired by three main flaws I've seen with other online Dice Rollers:

1. **Efficiency**
    - Problem: Most Dice Rollers have clunky UIs or unnecessary forms; as a result, it takes several button presses to roll a single dice.
    - Solution: Buttons are available to quickly roll 1-8 of a standard D&D dice set (d4, d6, d8, d10, d12, d20) with a single button press. While this should cover most use cases, the user can also
      enter a custom number of dice as well.
2. Aesthetically Pleasing:
    - Problem: Many Dice roller UIs are unattractive, poorly layed out, or don't support mobile/tablet screens very well. However, the most likely use case for a Dice Roller would be one's
      phone/tablet!
    - Solution: Create interface which is
        - simple,
        - supports dark/light mode and different color themes, and
        - supports mobile, tablet, and computer browsers and screen sizes.
3. Accessibility:
    - Problem: D&D and TTRPGs shoud be inclusive to everyone, but some websites aren't made with certain accessiblity needs in mind.
    - Solution: This dice roller is compatible with the Web Content Accessibility Guidelines (WCAG) 2.1 AA standards and uses the ARIA Authoring Practices Guide (APG) as a foundation for more
      complicated components.
